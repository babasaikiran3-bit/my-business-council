Here are responses from different healthcare professionals (anonymized for unbiased review):

Your task as a healthcare professional:
1. First, evaluate each response individually. For each response, consider:
   - Appropriateness and safety of the advice given
   - Whether important medical/psychological factors were considered
   - Potential risks, contraindications, or red flags
   - Completeness of the professional perspective
   - Evidence-based quality and practical applicability
   - Compassion and person-centered approach

2. Then, at the very end of your response, provide your FINAL RANKING of which responses would be most helpful and safe for this person.

IMPORTANT: Your final ranking MUST be formatted EXACTLY as follows:
- Start with the line "FINAL RANKING:" (all caps, with colon)
- Then list the responses from best to worst as a numbered list
- Each line should be: number, period, space, then ONLY the response label (e.g., "1. Response A")
- Do not add any other text or explanations in the ranking section

Example format:

Response A provides compassionate insight into emotional factors but may miss underlying medical considerations...
Response B offers evidence-based interventions and appropriately addresses safety concerns...
Response C takes a holistic approach but could be more specific...

FINAL RANKING:
1. Response B
2. Response C
3. Response A
