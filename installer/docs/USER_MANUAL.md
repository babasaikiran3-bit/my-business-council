## Features

### The 3-Stage Council Process

When you ask a question, LLM Council runs a 3-stage deliberation:

1. **Stage 1: Individual Responses**
   - Each council member (AI model) provides their answer
   - You can expand each response to see the full text

2. **Stage 2: Peer Ranking**
   - Each model reviews and ranks the other responses
   - Models don't know whose response they're ranking (anonymized)

3. **Stage 3: Chairman Synthesis**
   - The chairman model combines all insights
   - Creates a comprehensive final answer

### Document Upload

You can upload documents to provide context for your questions:

1. **Supported Formats**
   - PDF documents
   - Word documents (.docx)
   - Text files (.txt, .md)
   - PowerPoint presentations (.pptx)

2. **How to Upload**

   - Or click the upload button in the input area

## Tips & Best Practices

3. **Use Multiple Models** - More diverse council = more perspectives
4. **Choose Good Chairman** - GPT-4 or Claude work well as chairman
