# LLM Council

![llmcouncil](header.jpg)

The idea of this repo is that instead of asking a question to your favorite LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI GPT 5.1, Google Gemini 3.0 Pro, Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5, xAI Grok 4, eg.c), you can group them into your "LLM Council". This repo is a simple, local web app that essentially looks like ChatGPT except it uses OpenRouter to send your query to multiple LLMs, it then asks them to review and rank each other's work, and finally a Chairman LLM produces the final response.

## Vibe Code Alert

This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack because I wanted to explore and evaluate a number of LLMs side by side in the process of [reading books together with LLMs](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438). It's nice and useful to see multiple responses side by side, and also the cross-opinions of all LLMs on each other's outputs. I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

You need the following installed:
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for npm)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
  - Install with: `pip install uv` (or check their [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

### 2. API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

Get your API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).

### 3. Run

The project includes a single launch command that handles dependency installation and starts both backend and frontend.

**Windows:**
Double-click `start.bat` or run:
```cmd
start.bat
```

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
./start.sh
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Configuration (Optional)

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize the council members:

```python
COUNCIL_MODELS = [
    "openai/gpt-5.1",
    "google/gemini-3-pro-preview",
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "x-ai/grok-4",
]

CHAIRMAN_MODEL = "google/gemini-3-pro-preview"
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+), async httpx, OpenRouter API
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, react-markdown for rendering
- **Storage:** JSON files in `data/conversations/`
- **Package Management:** uv for Python, npm for JavaScript
